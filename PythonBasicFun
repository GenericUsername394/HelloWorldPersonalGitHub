# VARIABLES
x = 5 #read this as "x is assigned 5" or "x stores 5"
# NOT "x equals 5"
# a variable stores a value
# a value has a data type
# a data type defines a range fo values
# example: the int data type (short for integer) represents whole numbers
print (x)
print(type(x))
# let's say we want to reassign x a different value
x = 5.5
print(x)
print (type(x))
# example: the float data type (short for floating point nuber) represents
# numbers with fractional parts (AKA decimals)
x = "hello"
# example" the string data type represents a swquence of characters
print(x)
print(type(x))
x = "5"
print(x)
print(type(x))

# OPERATIONS
# PEMDAS: Parenthases, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction
# * is multiplication
print (4 * 5)
# / is floating point division (the "normal" divisoin)
print (5 / 2)
# // is integer divisoin (the whole number result of floating point division)
print (5 // 2)
# ** is exponentiation (power)
print (2** 5) #if multiple **, they evaluate right to left
# we can also use the pow() funtion from the math module
# need to import the math module to use it
# (aside" a .py file AKA a module AKA script)
print(math.pow(2,5))

# GETTING USER INPUT
#print("Enter your favorite number: ")
#favorite_number = input()
#print("Your favorite nunber is ", favorite_number)
#print("Your favorite numbber is ", favorite_number * 2, sep="*")
#print(type(favorite_number))
#print("hello" * 2, end="~~~~~~~~") # sep and end are called keyword arguments
#print("here")
#let's say, we really do want to double the favorite number
# we need to "convert" favorite_number the string to an int (or float)
# this is called type conversion and there are built-in functions to do this
#favorite_number_int = int(favorite_number)
#print(favorite_number_int, type(favorite_number_int))
#print("Your favorite number doubled is", favorite_number_int * 2)

#FORMATTING (decimal numbers)
# a few ways to do this
# 1. C style (old skool)
print(math.pi)
#round math
Print("%.2f" %(math.pi))
