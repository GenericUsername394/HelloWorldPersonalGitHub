# VARIABLES
x = 5 #read this as "x is assigned 5" or "x stores 5"
# NOT "x equals 5"
# a variable stores a value
# a value has a data type
# a data type defines a range fo values
# example: the int data type (short for integer) represents whole numbers
print (x)
print(type(x))
# let's say we want to reassign x a different value
x = 5.5
print(x)
print (type(x))
# example: the float data type (short for floating point nuber) represents
# numbers with fractional parts (AKA decimals)
x = "hello"
# example" the string data type represents a swquence of characters
print(x)
print(type(x))
x = "5"
print(x)
print(type(x))

# OPERATIONS
# PEMDAS: Parenthases, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction
# * is multiplication
print (4 * 5)
# / is floating point division (the "normal" divisoin)
print (5 / 2)
# // is integer divisoin (the whole number result of floating point division)
print (5 // 2)
# ** is exponentiation (power)
print (2** 5) #if multiple **, they evaluate right to left
# we can also use the pow() funtion from the math module
# need to import the math module to use it
# (aside" a .py file AKA a module AKA script)
print(math.pow(2,5))
